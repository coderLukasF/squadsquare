      <h1>Promotion guide.</h1>
      <p>
        If you would like to be promoted to a certain rank, let me know via this
        form! Someone from the promotion team will review your response and get
        back to you about if you can actually get this rank or not, if you can
        get this rank then our promotion team will study what you do and
        eventually you will hopefully get promoted to that rank!<br />
        <strong
          >BIG THING: Do NOT say "I deserve to be promoted", or "When will I get
          promoted?". This is called hinting. We decide if and when you get a
          promotion. <br style="margin: 15px" />TIP: If you want to become a
          higher rank of a normal one, ex: Player -> Head player you should do
          your job as your rank but better. Show us that you are capable and
          advanced. Its like going from an A to an A+. Thats the best way to get
          a promotion.</strong
